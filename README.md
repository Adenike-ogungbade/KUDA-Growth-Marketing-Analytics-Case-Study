# KUDA Growth & Marketing Analytics Case Study

## Overview

This project analyzes Kuda’s marketing performance across acquisition, retention, and revenue generation from January 2023 to December 2024.

The objective was to evaluate channel efficiency, identify high-value user segments, and provide data-driven recommendations to optimize marketing ROI and long-term growth.

---

## Business Problem

Kuda needed visibility into:

- Which acquisition channels drive the highest quality users
- How retention varies by channel over time
- Which channels generate the strongest revenue and ARPU
- How marketing budget could be optimized for sustainable growth

Channels analyzed:
- Referrals
- Google Ads
- Paid Social

---

## Data Sources

- Campaign performance dataset (CPA, activation rate, user acquisition)
- User cohort dataset (monthly retention tracking)
- Revenue dataset (channel-level revenue and ARPU)

---

## Tools & Methods

- **Excel** – Data cleaning, transformation, pivot-based cohort modeling
- **Power BI** – Data modeling, DAX measures, KPI dashboards
- Cohort retention calculation using month-over-month user activity tracking
- ARPU and revenue aggregation by acquisition channel

---

## Growth Funnel Analysis

Channels were evaluated across the full lifecycle:

**Acquisition → Activation → Retention → Revenue**

### Key Insights

- Referrals delivered the highest activation rate (90%) and lowest CPA (₦3,348).
- Paid Social showed weaker efficiency with 65% activation and highest CPA (₦4,931).
- Google Ads maintained balanced acquisition performance.
- Referrals demonstrated the strongest full-funnel performance, combining high activation, strong retention, and the highest ARPU (₦11,694).
- Paid Social drove awareness but experienced significant post-acquisition drop-off.

This analysis highlights that acquisition volume alone does not guarantee long-term revenue impact.

---

## Cohort Retention Analysis

Monthly cohorts were created to measure user retention across an 18-month period.

### Findings

- Referral users retained 37% activity after 18 months, significantly outperforming other channels.
- Paid Social users experienced the fastest retention decay.
- Google Ads retention remained moderate but stable.

High retention among Referral users directly supports stronger lifetime value (LTV).

## Revenue & Unit Economics

Revenue and ARPU were analyzed to assess long-term value by channel.

### Key Metrics

- Referrals generated ₦1.99B in total revenue.
- Google Ads generated ₦572M.
- Paid Social generated ₦487M.
- Referrals recorded the highest ARPU (₦11,694), indicating stronger user engagement and transaction activity.

Revenue growth from Referrals remained consistent across 2023–2024, demonstrating sustainable channel performance.

## Budget Optimization Simulation

A scenario analysis was conducted to evaluate reallocating 20% of Paid Social spend toward Referrals.

### Assumptions

- Referral CPA: ₦3,348  
- Paid Social CPA: ₦4,931  
- Referral ARPU: ₦11,694  
- Paid Social ARPU: ₦4,336  

### Projected Impact

- Reduced blended CPA
- Increased overall revenue contribution
- Improved long-term LTV due to stronger retention dynamics

This supports prioritizing capital allocation toward high-efficiency channels.

## Experimentation Framework

To further optimize growth, the following experiment design is proposed:

### Hypothesis
Increasing referral incentives will improve activation rate and long-term retention without disproportionately increasing CPA.

### Test Design
- Control Group: Standard referral incentive
- Test Group: Increased referral reward
- Primary Metric: Activation rate
- Secondary Metrics: 3-month retention, ARPU

### Success Criteria
Statistically significant improvement in activation and ARPU while maintaining acceptable acquisition cost.

---

## Strategic Recommendations

- Scale Referral program due to superior activation, retention, and revenue contribution.
- Optimize Paid Social targeting toward higher-intent users.
- Refine Google Ads keyword targeting for stronger conversion efficiency.
- Implement ongoing experiment-driven budget allocation.
- Monitor retention cohorts quarterly to detect churn inflection points early.

---

## Conclusion

The analysis demonstrates that Referral is Kuda’s strongest growth engine, delivering high conversion efficiency, superior retention, and sustained revenue impact.

By shifting from acquisition volume focus to full-funnel performance optimization, Kuda can drive more capital-efficient and scalable growth.
